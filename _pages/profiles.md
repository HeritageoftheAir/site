### Dr Peter Hobbins

Dr Peter Hobbins holds an ARC (Australian Research Council) DECRA (Distinguished Early Career Researcher Award) fellowship in the Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney. As an historian of science, technology and medicine, he is intrigued by the ways that knowledge is generated and applied, especially through interactions with non-humans. He has explored this topic via publications on medical research, human-animal relations, quarantine, military medicine and aviation safety. His role in the project will focus on community based collections in order to research and transform artefacts and archives into narrative texts, visualisations, and display elements for Case Studies 1 Air Memories and 2 Take-Off to Touchdown.

### Prof Tracy Ireland

Associate Professor Tracy Ireland is a researcher and lecturer in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra. She is an archaeologist and heritage specialist with over twenty five years’ experience across government, private practice and the academic sectors. Her research focuses on how the past impacts the present and how shared memory is constructed through heritage. Heritage of the Air builds directly upon her research strengths in heritage management, social and community values, and evolving forms of heritage practice. As well as heading up the project and coordinating inputs from all researchers, she will also lead Case Study 1 Air Memories; conduct research into community based heritage practices, and collaborate in developing exhibitions to celebrate the 2020 centenary of civil aviation in Australia.
