{: .center}

The Connecting the Nation: Australia’s Aviation Heritage report was compiled in 2015 to document the research undertaken throughout the duration of the project. This combined report includes: the scoping for this study of aviation heritage in Australia; a thematic analysis linked to collections, archives, people and places; key milestones and project outcomes; survey data regarding aviation heritage collections; and a discussion of the cultural significance and values of Australia’s aviation heritage. Prepared for Airservices Australia, this report is now available for the wider public to view.
