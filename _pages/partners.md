The Civil Aviation Historical Society (CAHS) exists to preserve the history of the Department of Civil Aviation, its predecessors and successors. The Society operates the Airways Museum at Essendon Airport, Melbourne. The Museum houses a collection of national importance that traces the development of Australia's civil aviation airways system through innovation and technical development from its beginnings in the 1920s to today. The story is told through artefacts and photographs, and illustrates how Australia has often played a leading role internationally in aviation development.
