**Paul Ashton (UTS)**: Paul and Tracy Ireland have written a late primary school children's book – Amazing Flights: A Century of Flying in Australia. Halstead Press will be publishing it in 2021.

Abstract: Today Maurice Guillaux's Bleriot XI hangs from a ceiling in the Powerhouse Museum. It seems largely ignored. It flew the first aerial mail run from Melbourne to Sydney in 1914, just before the outbreak of WWI. It was also full of other significant objects. This paper looks at how this object could be presented to children in creative non-fiction.
