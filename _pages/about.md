Heritage of the Air is a 3 year [Australian Research Council](https://www.arc.gov.au/) Linkage project that investigates how aviation has transformed Australian society over the last 100 years. In the lead up to Australia’s centenary of civil aviation, our focus is on people rather than planes and we seek to tell the broader story of diverse Australian communities and aviation. The project aims to engage with the public’s enduring fascination with aviation through innovative analyses and interpretation of little known aviation heritage collections, to produce exciting exhibitions, accessible digital collections and heritage resources, as well as scholarly publications.

The project is based at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/) and our research partners include [Airservices Australia](https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/), the [National Museum of Australia](https://www.nma.gov.au/), the [SFO Museum](https://www.sfomuseum.org/) in San Francisco, the [Queensland Museum](https://www.qm.qld.gov.au/) and the [Civil Aviation Historical Society](http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/) in Melbourne. Academic investigators are based at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) and [University of New England](https://www.une.edu.au/) in Armidale.
