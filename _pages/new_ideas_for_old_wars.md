Over 22â€“23 June 2018, three members of the Heritage of the Air team presented work on aviation heritage at [_"New Ideas for Old Wars: the Archaeology of War"_](https://anmm.blog/2018/05/23/the-archaeology-of-war/). Hosted by the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney, this conference brought together a mixed scholarly and public audience to hear from an international suite of presenters. In addition to battlefields and maritime archaeology, there was a strong aviation theme throughout the conference, including aircraft wrecks on land and underwater. You can listen to the audio from all of the talks on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/anmmuseum/sets/the-archaeology-of-war), including the panel presented by our three members:
