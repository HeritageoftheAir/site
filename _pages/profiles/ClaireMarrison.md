Dr Claire Marrison is the Standards and Systems Manager for Airservices Australia, one of the Partner Organisations of this project. In this role, she is responsible for the Operational and Work Health and Safety System, Quality Management System and the Environment Management System. The latter is the link to this project in that it places obligations on organisations to assure that heritage values are recognised and managed appropriately. She has initiated research on the heritage of Australian civil aviation and facilitates research on a wide range of related areas and factors crucial to continuous innovation and the environmentally and socially responsible management of Australian aviation safety. Her role in this project is to guide stakeholder and industry engagement and liaison, and work with the the researchers and Partner Organisations to ensure that research outcomes contribute positively to the development of operational and heritage policy for Airservices Australia in the future.
