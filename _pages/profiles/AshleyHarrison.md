Ashley completed a Master of Liberal Arts (Visual Culture Research) (Research), after majoring in Undergraduate Anthropology and Psychology, at the Australian National University. For her sub-thesis, Ashley explored the historical and contemporary use of archival images of Aboriginal ancestors taken in the ‘William Henry Corkhill and the Tilba Tilba Collection’ (held at the National Library of Australia). As a Yuin woman with mixed heritage, Ashley is particularly interested in considering cross-cultural intersections and utilising Indigenous research methods. Ashley's PhD project will focus on using archival collections, to find representations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultural responses to aviation.
