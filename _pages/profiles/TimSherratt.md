Associate Professor Tim Sherratt is an historian in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra who researches the possibilities and politics of digital cultural collections. He is interested in using digital tools to create new cultural experiences and new forms of publication, exploring how digitisation projects change our relationship with the past and digital heritage. He has worked across the cultural heritage sector and have been developing online resources relating to libraries, archives, museums and history since 1993. He will lead Case Study 2: _Take-Off to Touchdown_ and oversee all the digital components of the project, and investigate how digital tools and techniques can be applied to the projectâ€™s research themes.
