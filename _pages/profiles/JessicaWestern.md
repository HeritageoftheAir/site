Ms Jessica Western is a PhD candidate in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra. Her research interests include questions of politicisation/depoliticisation and engagement in cultural heritage management, the distinctive relationship between air travel and intangible cultural elements, and the potential offered by digital interpretation techniques. She will work with the Queensland Museumâ€™s aviation collections to establish a context for these through ethnographic and oral history research, as well as examining how digital heritage processes might broaden their cultural impact and contribute to an evolving multi-vocal heritage management practice.
