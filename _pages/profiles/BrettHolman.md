Dr Brett Holman is a researcher and lecturer in History in the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at the University of New England in Armidale. His research interests lie in ‘airmindedness’ and the aeroplane in British and Australian culture; the theory, anticipation and experience of aerial bombardment in Britain, c.1900 to 1945, particularly in the civilian and public sphere; aviation spectacle and aerial theatre in the modern period; and mystery aircraft scares in the early twentieth century. For this project, he will apply his theoretical frameworks for ‘airmindedness’ and related concepts such as aerial theatre, conducting historical and archival research for visualisations and interpretations of digitised collections for Case Study 1: _Air Memories_ and Case Study 2: _Take-Off to Touchdown_.
