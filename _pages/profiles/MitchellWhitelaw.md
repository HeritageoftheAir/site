Associate Professor Mitchell Whitelaw is a researcher and lecturer in the School of Art and Design in the College of Arts and Social Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra. His research spans practice and theory in the fields of digital design and culture; he works with data and computation as core materials in a creative research practice, and collaborates on applied, practice-led research with public outcomes. His theoretical work draws on and contextualises this practice, as well as investigating emerging concepts and forms in digital art and design. He will co-produce the project's digital outcomes, with specific emphasis on data handling, linking and transformation. He will also contribute to Case Study 1: _Air Memories_, on geographic investigations, laying out investment in landing grounds, air routes and traffic patterns.
