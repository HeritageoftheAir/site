Jana Samargis-Woods returned to Archaeology and Museum studies after working many years in the corporate sector. She completed a BA/BCom majoring in Archaeology and Economics at the University of Melbourne. Most recently she completed an MBA (2012) at Melbourne Business School. She also completed a Graduate Diploma in one of the earliest Museum Studies courses in 1993 at Deakin University. She has had three seasons of practical excavation experience working on an Early Bronze Age site at Marki in Cyprus with Latrobe University as a graduate student. Jana is currently an MA research candidate with the University of Sydney. She is thrilled to be returning to research and to be part of the Heritage of the Air project where she will be investigating aviation museum collections in Melbourne.
