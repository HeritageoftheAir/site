Dr Peter Hobbins holds an ARC (Australian Research Council) DECRA (Distinguished Early Career Researcher Award) fellowship in the Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney. As an historian of science, technology and medicine, he is intrigued by the ways that knowledge is generated and applied, especially through interactions with non-humans. He has explored this topic via publications on medical research, human-animal relations, quarantine, military medicine and aviation safety. His role in the project will focus on community based collections in order to research and transform artefacts and archives into narrative texts, visualisations, and display elements for Case Study 1: _Air Memories_ and Case Study 2: _Take-Off to Touchdown_.
