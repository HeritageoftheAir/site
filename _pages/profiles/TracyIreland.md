Associate Professor Tracy Ireland is a researcher and lecturer in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra. She is an archaeologist and heritage specialist with over twenty five yearsâ€™ experience across government, private practice and the academic sectors. Her research focuses on how the past impacts the present and how shared memory is constructed through heritage. Heritage of the Air builds directly upon her research strengths in heritage management, social and community values, and evolving forms of heritage practice. As well as heading up the project and coordinating inputs from all researchers, she will also lead Case Study 1: _Air Memories_; conduct research into community based heritage practices, and collaborate in developing exhibitions to celebrate the 2020 centenary of civil aviation in Australia.
